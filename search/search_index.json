There are two domains available for current model simulations, in East Africa and Southwest Asia (Data provided by FEWSNET), however, forecasted data are only available in East Africa. The data we are providing is volumetric soil moisture in the top 10 cm of the ground surface (i.e. percent of the soil that has water, so the max will usually be no greater that 50% (0.5)). The data is produced from the NOAH land surface model within NASA\u2019s Land Information System (LIS) framework that uses satellite based inputs (see references below). From the desert locusts experts that we have talked with, locust have 2 main requirements for successful breeding: that the volumetric soil moisture be in a specific range (~0.15 \u2013 0.25) and that soil type be pretty sandy (we\u2019ve found sand percentages between ~55-75% for locust observations).

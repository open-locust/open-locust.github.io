The Usable Data Mask v2 are an 8 bit 8 band image with the following bands. These tools are designed as modules that can be imported directly into any Google Earth Engine script and can then be used in a plug and play manner. Band Description Pixel Value Range Interpretation Band 1 Clear map [0, 1] 0: not clear, 1: clear Band 2 Snow map [0, 1] 0: no snow or ice, 1: snow or ice Band 3 Shadow map [0, 1] 0: no shadow, 1: shadow Band 4 Light haze map [0, 1] 0: no light haze, 1: light haze Band 5 Heavy haze map [0, 1] 0: no heavy haze, 1: heavy haze Band 6 Cloud map [0, 1] 0: no cloud, 1: cloud Band 7 Confidence map [0-100] percentage value: per-pixel algorithmic confidence in classification Band 8 Unusable pixels -- Equivalent to the UDM asset: see Planet's Imagery Specification for complete details UDM-2 classification stems from a supervised machine learning technique and is designed to seperate the the above classes. Things to note: All classes are mutually exclusive meaning you can be either of the classes in Band-1 to Band -6 The clases (Band-1 to Band-6) are binary as mentioned in the band list. The Confidence map value therefore refers to a single class and has a 1:1 correlation to the underlying imagery. To read more about the UDM-2 Classification Methodology you can go here at our Developers Center . Eventually this will allow you to apply cloud masking to PlanetScope Scenes and their related UDM-2 masks to create cloud free composites.

The data we are providing is volumetric soil moisture in the top 10 cm of the ground surface (i.e. percent of the soil that has water, so the max will usually be no greater that 50% (0.5)).
